# 06: Write it down

**Writing helps you clarify your thoughts and ideas before you share them. Writing makes your thoughts and ideas digestible for others. Writing doesn’t require everyone showing up at the same time. Writing is accessible. Writing is searchable. If it “could have been an email”, by all means. Default to writing.**

## The theory

When it comes to knowledge work, writing is the most sustainable and efficient way to communicate. Asynchronous writing helps your organization to build an organized, searchable, interconnected database of context and information. Most importantly, it empowers people to manage complex data, collaborate, and make decisions autonomously.

Writing is the ultimate idea clarifier. Clear writing is clear thinking, and vice versa. It ensures that messages aren’t just conveyed; they’re understood and can be expanded upon. A culture of writing leads to both stronger alignment for less effort and fewer half-baked ideas.

Even better, asynchronous writing has leveling effects, shifting the focus from the people who hog valuable meeting time to those who bring the most value to your goals. You want your best people, not your loudest. Writing promotes a culture where substance beats dominance.

Start with asynchronous writing and use other tools — like meetings — as they’re needed.
