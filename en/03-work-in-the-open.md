# 03: Work in the open

**Working in the open builds trust, a prerequisite for high-performance teams. Working in the open turns bottom-to-top information funneling into autonomy-enabling information sharing. Working in the open keeps stakeholders and adjacent teams up to speed without asks and interruptions.**

## The theory

In many traditional organizations, information flows in one direction: up the hierarchy, making it harder to access the lower you sit. Transparent organizations allow everyone access to the context they need to make informed decisions at all times, reducing the need for red tape and interruptions.

Transparency also encourages individuals to take ownership of their work and results, strengthening accountability across the organization. This model demystifies decision-making, promotes everyone’s engagement, and establishes interpersonal _trust – the proven key to high performance_.

Trust requires leadership, but you can’t lead if you can’t be seen. Leaders and managers working in the open serve as powerful role models for desired behaviors within the organization. Organizational leaders build trust with their reports by constantly shining a light on their own questions, course-corrections, and decisions.
