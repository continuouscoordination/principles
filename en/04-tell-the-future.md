# 04: Tell the future

**You can learn from history, but you can change the future. That makes communicating intent across your org an _actual superpower_. When contributors do it, leaders can course correct before days/weeks/months get burned. When leaders do it, contributors can drive progress autonomously.**

## The theory

Declaring individual or group intentions — whether it be daily plans, weekly objectives, or long term goals — has major benefits for contributors, managers, and your business.

Many organizations default to a culture of working reactively instead of proactively: constantly responding to the latest top-down requests and making little forward progress in the process.

Routinely communicating intent across the whole organization is an inherently clarifying practice, and a way to shift from a reactive to a proactive culture. It forces authors to envision outcomes rather than blindly react, providing an effective framework for thinking through and prioritizing the work along the way.

Furthermore, it provides the least expensive mechanism to course correct and therefore de-risk: _before_ a contributor or team sinks valuable time and resources in the wrong direction.

Finally, authored intent builds trust and autonomy up and down an organization. As the practice develops, the intentions become more pointed, course-corrections become rarer, and the opportunities for trust-eroding micro-management disappear.
