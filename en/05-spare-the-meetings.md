# 05: Spare the meetings

**The answer to everything can’t be “have a meeting”. Zoom fatigue is real, and people need big blocks of time to do deep work. Save meetings for the high-value stuff — collaborating, team-building — and use async tools for the rest.**

## The theory

“Meeting hours” are the most precious commodity in a knowledge organization, but they come with significant downsides:

- Meetings are expensive in shear payroll consumption, to the tune of _hundreds of millions of dollars_ at large companies.
- Meetings are zero-sum. You’re either talking about the work, or doing the work.
- Excess meetings are not only universally loathed, but often lead to burn out and disengagement.
- Rigid recurring meeting structures erase the flexibility advantage of remote and hybrid work.
- Meetings erode deep-work: developers, designers, and many other contributors need large, uninterrupted blocks of time to get into flow state and create value. Nothing of significance is getting done in that 30-minute gap between meetings.

Dissolving meetings altogether is not the answer. Meetings and 1:1s are absolutely vital, especially in remote and hybrid teams. Rich human interaction — collaborating, spit-balling, celebrating, commiserating, etc — is the foundation that great work and strong team culture is built on.

Get rid of low-value meetings — status meetings, high-frequency all-hands — in favor of written asynchronous communication and save your meeting budget for high-value conferences and teamwork.
