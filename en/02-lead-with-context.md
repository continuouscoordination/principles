# 02: Lead with context

**“Butts in seats” management is an engagement killer, and a non-starter when you can’t see actual butts in actual seats. Instead, give people the context and coaching they need to make independent decisions that move the business forward. High-autonomy teams are high-functioning teams.**

## The theory

People and teams do their best work when they understand _why_ that work matters, and why they’re uniquely suited to do it. So instead of deploying top-down management practices designed for the assembly line, provide a clear chain of goals rooted in the mission of the business, and let teams and people figure out how to get from A to B.

Contributors who help shape their work expectations and goals (“I do X, it’s necessary in order to get us to Y”) report higher satisfaction, productivity, and engagement. Because their work is nourished by their own sense of purpose, they're more likely do it well, and less likely to overextend and burn out.

Establish context with shared goals that focus on outcomes rather than blow-by-blow processes, and consistently relate these goals to parent objectives, mission, and vision company-wide.
