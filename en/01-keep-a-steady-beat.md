# 01: Keep a steady beat

**Ad-hoc approaches to keeping everyone informed and aligned are brittle, time-consuming, and tedious. Replace them with automated, structured communication loops to create a steady beat that keeps everyone in tight sync without all the effort and interruptions.**

## The theory

Modern organizations, where work happens over a variety of schedules and physical locations, face the challenge of picking between infrequent alignment (for example, quarterly roadmap planning) and frequent, manual alignment (daily meetings or ad-hoc interruptions).

This dilemma creates an *alignment trap*. Infrequent alignment can lead to outdated information guiding decisions, or a mixture of old and new information that causes “alignment drift.” Sure, there’s plenty of space and time for deep work, but the danger is that this work may be toward the wrong end, leading to wasted hours, days, or even weeks before communication catches up to the pace of the work. On the other hand, frequent, manual alignment consumes valuable work time and undercuts the actual utility of meetings: what work does happen is often exclusively for the meeting itself. Companies that default communication to meetings don’t meet to work; *they work to meet*.

To align teams and people, adopt a *dual-loop communication strategy*, with *high-frequency loops for individual teams* and *low-frequency loops for teams across the organization*.

High-frequency update loops — like brief, asynchronous daily check-ins from team members — enable individual teams to prioritize tasks and objectives, address budding issues, and coordinate action plans. Lower-frequency update loops — like mid-term risk assessments of long-term goals in progress — align multiple teams and address higher-level or organization-wide endeavors.

A dual-loop communication strategy streamlines alignment and promotes balance, consistency, and steady engagement across the organization. Plenty of space is opened up for deep work without sacrificing continuous context and while maintaining collaborative momentum.
